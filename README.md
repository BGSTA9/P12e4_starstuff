**"We are Star Stuff"**

_"The codebase implements a particle simulation where particles are emitted, attracted to the mouse position, and displayed with dynamic color changes based on their velocity. The Engine class drives the main application loop, while Emitter handles particle generation and motion. The use of SFML for rendering and user input makes it suitable for interactive visualization. This project could be used to simulate phenomena like dust clouds, with a glowing effect that emphasizes particle speed and direction."_
